Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room, they came to us looking to turn their web based application into an application that served a wider variety of devices.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
On this job, I did well on memory management and memory utilization. This was cost-effective for the client and showed multiple method of approach.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the document was very helpful, keeping thoughts organized and on track with the project. It was also very easy to go back and reflect or change things.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the domain model could use some work, we could further analyze our solutions to make a better description and explanation for the client.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Without the client, we have no business. We must consider and implement the clients needs to best develop the application. Considerations for scalability, 
security, cost, and performance were considered in this project.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
We reccomended caching in areas of the application to ensure best performance. In the future we will prioritize the same factors from the client, better
outlining our application in each area.
